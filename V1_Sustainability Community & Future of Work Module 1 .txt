Growing Focus on the SDGs
Achieving the SDGs will require between US$3 trillion and US$5 trillion in investment per year in developing countries alone (UN Commission on Trade and Development).
Current annual investment in achieving the SDGs sits at US$1.4 trillion.


Investors are increasingly using the UN SDGs as a means of aligning with long-term environmental and social objectives.

Sustainable Development Goals & UNDP
UNDP supports countries in three different ways, through the MAPS approach.

Mainstreaming
Acceleration
Policy Support

Mainstreaming: Providing support to governments to reflect the new global agenda in national development plans and policies (underway in many countries)
Acceleration: Supporting countries to accelerate progress on SDG targets. 
Policy support: Making the UN’s policy expertise on sustainable development and governance available to governments at all stages of implementation.
40

While the SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to take ownership and establish national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 goals.


Countries have the primary responsibility for follow-up and review of the progress made in implementing the Goals, which will require quality, accessible and timely data collection.


Regional follow-up and review will be based on national-level analyses and contribute to follow-up and review at the global level.

Fastest- growing green skills are in ecosystem management, environmental policy, and pollution prevention. 

Companies state that around 40% of workers will need reskilling for up to 6-months to perform sustainability-focused jobs well.


Job postings that require green skills grew at 8% annually over the past five years, but people with the right skills have only grown by about 6%


The gap in the skills needed to do green jobs will continue to be high through to 2025, as in demand skills across jobs change.

Influence: those who can influence the achievement of the goals of your organization, those who have influence in an unofficial capacity and those who have official authority to make decisions internally or externally.
Dependency: those who depend more on your organization, customers who rely on your products/services, or suppliers of which you are a major customer.
